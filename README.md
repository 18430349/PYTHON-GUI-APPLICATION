# PYTHON-GUI-APPLICATION
This is a coursework i  did in my first year programming about designing, building, testing and evaluating a python GUI  application that displays a set of images (png, gif, jpg, etc)  of friends as a gallery.  Each image displayed will also have a label underneath showing the image name.  The user interacts with the gallery through a set of buttons.

The buttons are described below. 
Buttons 

Button ‘Show pictures’ – should display all images from the folder that has all the images for this application. Repeated press of the button should only render one set of all images. The image displayed should
show the image name i.e. friend’s name. 

Button ‘Clear Gallery’ – should clear the gallery, if displayed and just show the main GUI window with a single frame that has the menu buttons. This button should only function if the images are visible. 

Button ‘Delete a Friend’ – should launch underlying operating system window showing the files in the relevant folder. The user will select the friend image to be deleted which will invoke a message window (popup)
seeking confirmation of the deletion. The deletion will only be carried out if the user confirms it and the images will be redisplayed without the deleted one. 

Button ‘Add New Friend’ – should launch underlying operating system window showing the files in any folder that the image may be. The user will select the friend image to be added that will invoke a message window (popup) seeking confirmation of the addition. The addition will only be carried out if the user confirms it and the images will be redisplayed without the added one. 

Button ‘Quit’ – should quit the application. The user interface is a single window with a number of frames. The application aesthetics will demonstrate good HCI understanding in areas of colours, fonts, look 
and feel.
